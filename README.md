## Introduction
Being students during the pandemic made us see in first person the transition between traditional lectures to online ones and then to mixed ones (in-person lectures with a percentage of students following from home). Professors employed many different approaches, from using a webcam to record the black board to pivoting to just using slides. Every approach has some pros and cons, but none was optimal for everyone; for this reason we decided to develop a cheap and effective solution that could be easily implemented in every classroom while also optimizing the experience both from the classroom and from home.
