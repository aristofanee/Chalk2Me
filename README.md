# Chalk2Me
A univerisity project done for the course of Computing Systems (Politecnico di Milano, Engineering Physics).
## Introduction
Being students during the pandemic made us see in first person the transition from traditional lectures to online and then to mixed ones (in-person lectures with a percentage of students following from home). Professors employed many different approaches, from using a webcam to record the black board to pivoting to just using slides. Every approach has some pros and cons, but none was optimal for everyone; for this reason we decided to develop a cheap and effective solution that could be easily implemented in every classroom while also optimizing the experience both from the classroom and from home.
## Our Solution
Inspired by projects like [Wiimote Whiteboard](https://archive.org/details/wiimote-whiteboard), we designed a casing for the chalk that has a pressure sensor that detects when the professor writes on the board and an IR led that allows for the movement tracking. The tracking itself can be easily done with a Wiimote that acts as an IR camera. 

Here's a demo of the device in function:
